# Mafia Forum
Hello, we would like to introduce you to our mafia forum. 
To use the program, you will need the following dependencies (all included in the package.json):
bcrypt
cookie-parser
express-handlebars
express-session
express
mongodb
node-uuid.
From there it is fairly simple to run the code. To do so, type npm start.
Now you can access the server at localhost:3000 which will you bring you to the frontpage as an unlogged in user.
From here you can either browse the public threads of other people playing, login in by clicking the hyperlink or sign up by clicking the hyper link. 
If you choose to access the threads, you will not be able to participate and create posts. You will only be able to view posts and click on peoples profiles to view their information.
If you choose to sign up, it will send you to a new page where it will ask for your information and it will tell you if there is a user with your username already.
If you choose to login it, it will take you to the login screen where you can either navigate back to the frontpage, navigate to the sign up page, or input your information and sign in. If you sign in correctly, it will bring you back to the frontpage but with more permissions. if you click on any public threads, you can now post on those threads. You will also be able to see what threads you have participated in so far and you will be able to click on your username hyperlink to access your information and change it if necesary. 
You are now ready to use the mafia forum and play now.
